                    <p>I'm a second-generation programmer. My dad introduced me to programming when I was a child. He taught me QBasic (shows you my age) and I felt really smart when I showed my friends I could draw silly pictures on the computer using code. My friends were impressed, so I started teaching them, too. Fast forward and one of those friends was so interested in programming that he got a degree in software engineering and became a programmer. Although I enjoyed coding I, for some reason, chose to become a scientist.</p>
                    <p>I had a successful career in the aquaculture feed industry formulating diets for all kinds of aquatic animals (and even some dogs and reptiles), overseeing quality assurance and quality control, and leading R&D projects. Being in aquaculture requires living in exotic places, which was not a problem until having my first child. Eventually, things just weren't going well for the family, so I'm switching careers into programming.</p>
